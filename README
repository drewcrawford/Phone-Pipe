phonepipe lets you send push notifications to your iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad from the commandline  You need to have the Notifo app installed on your device.

phonepipe will take your credentials from standard input and save them to ~/.phonepipe on the first run.

To install, use
	python phone.py ---install

Python <=2.4 users see the section at the end.


	

To notify yourself when the compile is done, use
	make; phone

To copy your ip addresses, use
	ifconfig | grep inet | phone

All phonepipe arguments begin with '---'.  The reason is because I am occasionally so lazy as to not enquote the messages I want to send (and I occasionally send messages with '--' in them, i.e. outputs of commands, etc.), so phonepipe accepts unquoted command line arguments as a message.  Both of these do the same thing:

	phone send this message
	phone "send this message"

Usage:
	phone [---title=<title>] [---label=<label>] [---url=<url>] [message]

title: title of the message, usually given its own line
label: label of the message.  For most notifo notifications, this indicates the name of the sending service.  
url: Notifo has a URL field that allows you to navigate to that URL with a tap from inside the app.

phonepipe also accepts a message from standard input.
